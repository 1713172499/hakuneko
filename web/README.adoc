= HakuNeko Web-Application

== Introduction

The HakuNeko web-application is mostly written using https://www.polymer-project.org[Polymer].

== Deployment

Currently this can be only done by running the following command on linux platform:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Projects/web
./publish.sh
----

This will process the following steps:

. Create a zip archive of the web-application
. Create a signature of the archive with the private key of the corresponding public key that is embedded in the desktop client (otherwise the desktop client will reject this archive)
. Place the artifacts in HakuNeko's _Release_ git repository and push the changes (content will be published to the host through a hook)
